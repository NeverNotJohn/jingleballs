					hi! um tbh im rlly bad at doing these letter things. To start, happy four months! I read somewhere that like u know u rlly love someone after <b>four</b> months cause like that's when humans get real sick of others, and like ur like v poggers. 
				</p>

				<p id="two" class="hidden">
					As much as I like to joke about how we met and what i thought of you in the beginning, i rlly find it so crazy that this lil <b>hmong</b> weeb i find adoring and craving cuddles everyday (but you already know that). I love to tell the story because i truly believe once i got to see ur personality and the person you are, i couldn't look back, i was absolutely adored with u. even after that Uniqlo trip at San Jose i just wanted to stick with u. ah um. lol this is kinda hard to write lololllolol :>.
				</p>

				<p id="three" class="hidden">
					ah- uhhh another tangent! So, I'm really happy ur family likes me. Today I caught ur mom introducing me as her kid to the cafe auntie, but caught herself not too soon after. This really warmed my heart and i see how ur mom truly thinks im her son LOL. I guess I'm <b>adopted</b> too now lmao. i miss u. and if ur reading this like way later i miss u. and ik that's true bc if ur reading this then ur not looking at me and then that means i miss u. so haha checkmate. so i love you. like a lot. like a lot lot. like a LOT LOT LOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.
				</p>

				<p id="four" class="hidden">

				<p id="five" class="hidden">
					i stole this code from someone LMAO
				</p>

				<p id="six" class="hidden">
					i love how u listen to me yap about my work and engineering this and engineering that, there rlly isn't anyone else that i can talk to and yap about. and ik it can be kind of boring and i sound pretentious a lot (lol) but im baffled that u bear through that and truly listen lololol. i find that very loving and i really really appreciate it. and it is very weird and boring LOL and I've always thought of ways to make it sound interesting. With many other people not in the space i just simply say: "i shoot rocket" or some shit. but with u i yap and yap and yap and yap and u listen and <b>iushdfihsadfah</b> idk it just makes me v happy. AND U CAN DO THAT FOR ME TOO. i like it when u yap to me about style and fashion n stuff. i can be v like .-. bc like idk im not good at showing it (or im driving xd) but pls yap to me. i like it when ur eyes shimmer talking about "the lethal face card of lana somethin somethin" i forgor her name (i'm just a boy) BUT ITS CUTE. so uh ya. meow.

					i like to make these little things for u. i wanna use all my skills at my disposal to show my love for you. Recently working has been getting more and more tough. It's not necessarily hard, but i just feel kind of burnt out to do anything really, and my room has been getting messier and messier over time, and around this time every year i feel like this. This year i feel so much more motivated to work because I have u! And tbh, idk if this is bad or kind of overstepping but this is because I like to imagine that im working to provide u a stable life in the future. Thinking of lil Leon and <b>Norimae</b> make me kinda happy lol. Forgive me for having putting u in this place or if any if u feel any expectation pressure (and tell me if it is much... i'll probs keep these thoughts to myself from now on), it just has been helping get through day by day and giving me a reason to do what i'm doing. So, i wanna make these projects for u so i can show u the type of stuff I work on and what is looks like! It's hard to really showcase my skills as an engineer compared to modeling, for example, but I'm glad u can be an outlet to my creativity :>
